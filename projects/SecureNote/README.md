# SecureNote (Concept)

**Objective**
Explore how Apple's Keychain and Secure Enclave protect sensitive data such as notes, passwords, and app credentials.

**Goal:**
- Understand how the iOS Keychain works
- Research the Secure Enclave's role in protecting cryptographic keys
- Build a proof-of-concept "Secure Note" app simulation (in pseudo-code) that demonstrates encrypted local storage

**Future Additions:**
- Integrate Face ID / Touch ID authentication
- Add custom encryption demo
- Compare Apple's secure note storage to Android's Keystore system
